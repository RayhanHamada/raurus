# Package Agent Guide

## Package Context

This package is `@raurus/server`, a contract-first, OpenAPI-driven HTTP server built on Elysia with `@elysia/openapi`. It provides a fetch-compatible router, a runtime-generated OpenAPI 3.1 document, and a built-in Scalar API reference. It uses `@raurus/logger` for structured logging and never calls `configure()` itself — that is the responsibility of the consuming application.

## Architecture

```

## Key Concepts

- **Single public export** — `raurus()` from `@raurus/server` is the only entry point. It creates a fetch-compatible runtime from adapter options. `CreateRuntimeOptions` is also exported as a type for consumers.
- **Route options** — `routes.ts` takes `RouteOptions` with `metadata` and `storage` adapter objects directly, rather than receiving them through Elysia decorate/store.
- **Logging** — Use `getPackageLogger("server")` from `@raurus/logger` for runtime, route, and adapter logs. The server package only obtains loggers; the consuming app is responsible for calling `configure()` from `@logtape/logtape` once at startup.
- **Health check route** — `GET /` returns `{ status: "OK", message: "RAURUS_ENDPOINT" }` and is documented under the `Operations` OpenAPI tag. Use it for monitoring and liveness probes.
- **Inline OpenAPI** — The `@elysia/openapi` plugin is configured inline in `utils.ts` with OpenAPI servers derived from parsing `baseUrl` (a required `string | URL`). When the pathname is `/`, the API prefix defaults to `_raurus`.
- **Schema modules** — `models.ts` exports plain Elysia TypeSystem schemas. Routes import the whole module as `import * as m from "./models"` and reference members as `m.PresignedUrlQuerySchema` etc. — keep the namespace import convention when adding routes.
- **Fetch-compatible** — `createRuntime()` returns `{ fetch }`, compatible with Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and other WinterCG runtimes.

## Package Standards

- Keep runtime logic under `src/runtime/` — `src/index.ts` is a thin barrel that re-exports `raurus` and `CreateRuntimeOptions` from `./runtime`
- Define schemas in `models.ts` using `t.Object()` / `t.String()` etc. from Elysia's TypeSystem
- Routes import schemas via `import * as m from "./models"` and reference them as `m.SchemaName` — do not switch to named imports without a reason
- Pass adapter dependencies to `routes()` via `RouteOptions`, not through Elysia state
- Inline OpenAPI metadata (title, version, servers) in `utils.ts` — no separate config module
- Export the runtime factory as `raurus` from `src/runtime/index.ts`
- Use `@raurus/logger` for all logs; create module-level `const log = getPackageLogger("server")` loggers and do not call `configure()` inside this package

## Workflow

- Read the root `AGENTS.md` before planning or implementing changes
- Build with `bun run build` (tsdown with ESM output)
- Run tests with `bun run test` (vitest)
- Type-check with `bun run typecheck`

## Package Notes

- Build uses tsdown with entries `src/index.ts`, `src/runtime/index.ts`, and `src/adapters/*/index.ts` — new adapter subdirectories are auto-picked up
- Each adapter subdirectory under `src/adapters/` must have a corresponding `exports` entry in `package.json` (e.g. `"./adapters/example-metadata-adapter": "./dist/adapters/example-metadata-adapter/index.mjs"`)
- Adapters extend the base config interfaces from `@raurus/core` (`RuntimeMetadataAdapterBaseConfig`, `RuntimeStorageAdapterBaseConfig`) and use factory types for type safety
- Example adapters (`example-metadata-adapter`, `example-storage-adapter`) provide in-memory Map-based implementations for development and testing — imported via `@raurus/server/adapters/example-metadata-adapter` and `@raurus/server/adapters/example-storage-adapter`
- All adapters must implement `checkConnection()` from `CommonRuntimeAdapter` (returns `{ ok: boolean; message?: string }`)
- Routes use adapter guard clauses for optional methods (e.g. `createPresignedUploadUrl`) — return a 400 with `ErrorResponseSchema` when an adapter does not implement them
- Handlers currently return only the response envelope (e.g. presigned URL handler returns the URL but does not yet integrate `metadata.upsertContentMetadata`) — wire to full adapter logic when ready
